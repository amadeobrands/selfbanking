# SelfBank

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

## Development server
Notes from Dev to Dev on this git reposority as of 4/26/2020:

Run `npm run start` to run server, after navigating into frontend and running `ng build` which created the build folder for the front end that is referenced in the server.js file. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. Note, the app does NOT automatically rebuild itself, if you want to work on the front without working with the backend, just do ng build on the frontend folder and run `ng serve` and work under `http://localhost:4200`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
